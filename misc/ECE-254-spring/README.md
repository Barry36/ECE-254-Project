# ECE-254
These are the lab projects from ECE 254 (Operating Systems) at The University of Waterloo in Spring 2018.<br>
Labs were completed by Michael Rokas and Luke Seewald.

Labs 1 & 2 were built for ARM RL-RTX boards with a Cortex-M3 whereas labs 3 & 4 are built for standard Linux environments

## Lab Descriptions
* [Lab 1](lab1): Implement kernel primitives to provide task information in an RL-RTX operating System

* [Lab 2](lab2): Implement kernel primitives to block and unblock tasks attempting to allocate memory based on when memory blocks in a mempool are available in an RL-RTX operating System

* [Lab 3](lab3): Implement a solution to the producer/consumer problem in a standard Linux environment using both processes and threads

* [Lab 4](lab4): Implement memory allocation systems using both best and worst fit algorithms
