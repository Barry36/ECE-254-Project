1. Read the RTX Library Reference in the Keil IDE Help (see 1.12) and answer the following questions:
1.1 (1 point) In an RTX application, how to declare a memory pool named "mympool" that has 20 blocks 
    of memory with block size of 12 bytes?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer: _declare_box(mympool, 12, 20)

1.2 (1 point) Write one line of code to initialize the "mympool".
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer: _init_box(mympool, sizeof(mympool), 12)

1.3 (1 point) What is the corresponding kernel function of _alloc_box()?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer: rt_alloc_box()

1.4 (1 point) What is the corresponding kernel function of _free_box()?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer: rt_free_box()

2. (2 points) Read the rt_TypeDef.h file. What is the purpose of ret_val in the struct OS_TCB?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer: ret_val is a U32 value (for ECE254) returned upon completion of a wait

3. Read the rt_List.c file and answer the following questions:
    You may want to further explore other functions in the rt_List.c file.
3.1 (2 points) What does the rt_put_prio() function do?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer: it puts the task on the priority list

3.2 (2 points) What does the rt_get_first() function do?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer: it gets the first task (with the highest priority, at the head of the list)

4. Read the rt_Task.c file and answer the following questions:
4.1 (2 points) What does the rt_block() function do?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer: It blocks the task currently running and selects the next task that is ready

4.2 (2 points) What does the rt_dispatch() function do?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer: it dispatches the next task (or the next ready task with highest priority)

5. (4 points) How to set the return value of a function becomes a bit tricky when context
    switching is involved. One such example is os_mbx_wait() function. This function
    will return OS_R_MBX if the task has waited until a message was put in the mailbox
    (i.e. the task was blocked to wait for a message to arrive and then unblocked when
    the message arrives). Read the rt_Mailbox.c file and find the lines where the return
    value of OS_R_MBX is set. 
    Why does the corresponding kernel function rt_mbx_wait()
    not have a line to set the return value to OS_R_MBX? You may skip the code in
    functions isr_mbx_receive() and rt_mbx_psh() for the purpose of completing this
    assignment.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer: 
        This is because the value OS_R_MBX means that the task is waiting for a message to be put in the mailbox,
        so there is no need to return this value from rt_mbx_wait(). 
        
        Thus, the return value is set by rt_mbx_send() instead of the rt_mbx_wait (line 54). 

        However, rt_mbx_wait() waits for a message to be put into the mailbox. 

6. (2 points) To block a task, you will need to create a queue that the blocked tasks
    can stay. There are two global queues for now in the kernel and they are os_rdy and
    os_dly. What data structure do these two queues use?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer: the os_rdy and os_dly are doubly linked lists of OS_XCB structs
